CODING QUESTIONS SECTION
=====================================================
Question 1
Topic: Loops

Question Name: The Even Sum Accumulator

Description: Create a logic that calculates the sum of all even integers from 1 up to and including a specified limit. The solution should handle cases where the limit is zero or a negative number by returning a sum of zero.

Question 2
Topic: Functions

Question Name: Temperature Converter

Description: Implement a calculation that transforms a Fahrenheit temperature value into Celsius. The final result must be a numerical value formatted or rounded to exactly two decimal places to ensure precision.

Question 3
Topic: Algorithms

Question Name: Palindrome Detector

Description: Develop a process to check if a provided string reads the same forward as it does backward. The logic must ignore any differences in letter casing (capitalization) and must disregard all spaces within the text.

Question 4
Topic: Command Line Commands

Question Name: Repeater Script

Description: Design a script meant to be executed via the terminal that accepts a piece of text and a number. The script should output that text repeated a specific number of times, as a single continuous string.

Question 5
Topic: Data Structures

Question Name: Cheapest Item Finder

Description: Create a search tool that looks through a collection of products and their associated prices. The logic should identify and return the name of the product with the lowest price. It should also account for the possibility of an empty collection.

Question 6
Topic: Data Manipulation

Question Name: Email Sanitizer

Description: Build a routine that accepts a list of raw email strings. The process must sanitize the data by removing accidental whitespace at the beginning or end of each entry and converting all text to lowercase. Finally, the routine must remove any duplicate entries and return a unique list of clean emails.

Question 7
Topic: String Formatting

Question Name: Receipt Aligner

Description: Develop a formatting tool that produces a line of text for a receipt. The output must be a fixed width of 25 characters, with the item name pushed to the far left and the price (prefixed with a currency symbol and showing two decimal places) pushed to the far right.
